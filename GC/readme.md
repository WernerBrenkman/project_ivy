# Project 4: Readme

## Group Members: Werner, Gabriella and Petronella

For our R Macine Learning Project, we will be doing the 
[House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) from Kaggle. 


The objective of this project is to explore the influencers that impact house prices and in doing so, be challenged to predict the final price of a home.

Scope of the project: 
* Incorporate some EDA to gain insights in the data provided. In doing so, our project won't only be a predictive one but a descriptive one too. 
* If needed, employ data imputation techniques.
* Finally, build a ML model(s) to predict the final price of a home using the ML techniques we have learnt over the last couple of weeks. 
* If time allows and all team members agree, submit model on the Kaggle website to see how we fare against other teams.
